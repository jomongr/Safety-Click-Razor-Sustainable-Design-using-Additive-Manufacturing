# 🪒 Safety Click Razor – Sustainable Design

## 📌 Overview
This project redesigns a traditional double-edge safety razor to improve safety, ergonomics, and sustainability.

The design replaces threaded mechanisms with a click-based system and applies topology optimization with additive manufacturing principles to achieve a lightweight, safe, and recyclable product.
